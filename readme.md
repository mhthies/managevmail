# Command line management tool for vmail database

This Python script aims to provide a simple command line interface to manage virtual mail accounts in an MySQL database
that is organized as explained in the great tutorial of Thomas Leister:

https://thomas-leister.de/mailserver-debian-stretch/

The database layout, he is proposing, includes a table `accounts` with information (name, password hash, quota, enabled
flag, sendonly flag) on virtual mail accounts to be used by dovecot and a table `aliases` to be used by postfix for
redirects. Managing them is somehow compilcated, as it requires dealing with cumbersome SQL queries and the additional
usage of the `doveadm` command to hash passwords.

This script provides simple and dialog-oriented command line commands to get a quick overview over accounts and aliases
and modify them.

Management of the `domains` and `tlspolicies` tables must (for now) still be done manually, which should be okay, since
it is required rather rarely.


## Install

You need Python 3 and the Python 3-MySQL-Connector:

```
$ apt install python3-mysql
```

Now download the script (or clone it out from GitHub) and move it to any place you like. Move the configuration file
`config.ini` to `/etc/managevmail/config.ini` (which is the default location) or any other place you like (which then
requires the `-c` parameter to use the script). Chmod the `config.ini` file, if neccessary, to be only readable for
root (or any user/group you want to empower to manage the vmail database).

```
$ install -D -m 640 config.ini /etc/managevmail/config.ini
```

Create a MySQL user for the management, grant it SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT and DELETE privileges on the `vmail` database
and enter the MySQL credentials into the `config.ini`:

```
> CREATE USER managevmail@localhost IDENTIFIED BY '<your random password>';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.08 sec)

> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE ON vmail.* TO managevmail@localhost;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

```


## Usage

The script is meant to be executed with root privileges. Actually, they are (by default) only required to fetch the
current quota usage with `doveadm` and delete mailbox directories of deleted accounts, while all other actions require
only access to the database, i.e. to read the config.ini file.

The basic syntax is:

```
$ managevmail.py [-c path/to/config.ini] COMMAND [ADDRESS]
```

The commands are:

| Command     | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| list        | List all known accounts and aliases. Aliases are displays with their destination, disabled and sendonly addresses are flagged. Does not require an address |
| show        | Show all relevant information on the account or the alias (or both) to the given address. This even queries the quota usage from Dovecot.                  |
| add         | Add an account. Queries interactively for quota, enabled flag, sendonly flag and password.                                                                 |
| change      | Change settings of an account. Queries interactively for quota, enabled flag and sendonly flag.                                                            |
| pw          | Change password of an account. Queries interactively for the new password.                                                                                 |
| delete      | Delete an account. Asks for confirmation, asks again for confirmation of mailbox deletion.                                                                 |
| addalias    | Add an alias. Queries interactively for enabled flag and destination address.                                                                              |
| changealias | Change settings of an alias. Queries interactively for enabled flag and destination address.                                                               |
| deletealias | Delete an alias. Asks for confirmation.                                                                                                                    |
